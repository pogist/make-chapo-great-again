# 🐸

This extension replaces occurrences of the new facebooks's frog emoji with the old one (aka. chapo)

*Note*: Works on both chrome and firefox.

### Features

Right now, those are the places where the extension is able to replace chapos:

- chat tab
- feed units (and its comments)
- messenger dialog

### Running the extension on chrome

First of all, clone and build the project.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pogist/make-chapo-great-again
$ cd make-chapo-great-again
$ yarn install && yarn zip
```

Then, open the newly generated `dist` folder on chrome.
